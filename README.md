# SysTickets-IT-Diagnotic-Tool
A Python-based IT support ticketing tool that captures system and network diagnostics and stores them with help desk tickets using a local SQLite database. Future plans include cloud database functionality. It supports ticket creation, status updates, searching, filtering, and persistent storage to simulate real-world IT support workflows.
